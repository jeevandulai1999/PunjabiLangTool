## üîß How to Change Voice

### Option 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)

Edit your `.env` file:

```bash
TTS_VOICE=onyx    # Try: nova, onyx, shimmer, alloy, echo, fable
TTS_SPEED=0.95    # Adjust: 0.8 (slower) to 1.1 (faster)
TTS_MODEL=tts-1-hd # Or "tts-1" for faster/cheaper
```

Then restart the server:
```bash
python run.py
```

### Option 2: Quick Test Different Voices

Try each voice to find your favorite:

```bash
# In your .env file, try one at a time:
TTS_VOICE=nova     # Restart and test
TTS_VOICE=onyx     # Restart and test
TTS_VOICE=shimmer  # Restart and test
```

## ‚ö° Speed Settings

- **0.85**: Slower, very clear (good for beginners)
- **0.95**: Default, natural and clear
- **1.0**: Normal speed
- **1.1**: Slightly faster (for advanced learners)

## üí∞ Cost Difference

- **tts-1**: $15 per 1M characters (fast, high quality) ‚≠ê
- **tts-1-hd**: $30 per 1M characters (highest quality, slower)

**Recommendation**: The default `tts-1` is **perfect for most users** - it's fast, sounds great, and costs less (~$0.004 per typical session). Use `tts-1-hd` only if you want the absolute best quality and don't mind slower responses.

TTS_MODEL=tts-1
TTS_VOICE=nova
