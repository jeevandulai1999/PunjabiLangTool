We’re envisioning a Punjabi language learning app that uses conversational AI to help users practice real-world scenarios in Punjabi. The core stack involves:

GPT for generating natural dialogue

Whisper for speech-to-text transcription

OpenAI’s text-to-speech for natural Punjabi audio responses

Key Features (Proof of Concept)

Scenario-based conversations:
Users can choose from predefined real-world scenarios (e.g., at the market, school pickup, asking directions) or type in their own scenario prompt to generate a customized conversational partner.

Live speech interaction:
As users speak, their Punjabi is transcribed in three formats:

Gurmukhi script (e.g., ਤੁਸੀਂ ਕਿਵੇਂ ਹੋ?)

Romanised Punjabi (e.g., tusi kiven ho?)

English meaning (e.g., How are you?)

Character-based responses:
Each scenario presents a generated character (e.g., shopkeeper, teacher, stranger) who talks naturally in Punjabi and responds based on context. The AI character speaks back using OpenAI’s text-to-speech in natural-sounding Punjabi.

Side panel “Help Mode”:
At any point, the user can pause the scenario and ask a separate AI assistant for:

Grammar explanations

Vocabulary breakdowns

Cultural/contextual clarification

Example alternatives (e.g., more polite version, simpler phrasing)

Future Roadmap

After validating the concept with 1–2 scenarios, we can expand to:

More scenario types and user personas

Basic progress tracking (e.g., vocabulary mastered, time spent speaking)

Achievement system to gamify consistency

Option to save and review conversations

Accent-aware feedback using Whisper's confidence metrics
