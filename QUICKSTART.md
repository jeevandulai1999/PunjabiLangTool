# Quick Start Guide üöÄ

Get up and running with the Punjabi Language Learning Tool in 5 minutes!

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- OpenAI API key ([Get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))

## Setup (5 steps)

### 1. Activate Virtual Environment (if using one)

```bash
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

You should see `(.venv)` or similar in your prompt.

### 2. Install Dependencies ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT!

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**This step is required!** The application won't run without these packages.

To verify installation:
```bash
pip list | grep fastapi   # macOS/Linux
pip list | findstr fastapi  # Windows
```

### 3. Configure API Key

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
# Windows
copy env.example .env

# macOS/Linux
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your API key:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
python run.py
```

Or:

```bash
uvicorn backend.api.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 5. Open in Browser

Navigate to: http://localhost:8000

### 6. Allow Microphone Access

When prompted, click "Allow" to enable microphone for speech recording.

## First Conversation

2. Listen to the AI greeting in Punjabi
3. **Hold down** the "Hold to Speak" button

6. See your speech transcribed in 3 formats
7. Listen to the AI's response

## Need Help?

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (fast, no API calls)
pytest

```

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" Error
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

### Microphone Not Working
