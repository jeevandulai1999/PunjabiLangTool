"""Phoneme extraction service using a universal recognizer.

This module wraps the Allosaurus universal phoneme recognizer so that we can
extract time-aligned phoneme probabilities for Punjabi audio. Allosaurus was
chosen because its multilingual training corpus includes Indo-Aryan languages
and it exposes timestamped outputs, which makes it a good fit for Punjabi while
keeping the dependency lightweight compared to training a custom model.
